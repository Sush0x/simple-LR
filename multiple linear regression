#Multiple Linear Regression
#Theory  - y(Profit) = b0 + b1*x1(R&D Spend) + b2*x2(Administration)+....+ bn*xn

#Data is about 50 startup companies investing in the different sectors to gain profit
#Idea is to determine which investment leads to high profit or may be which city is good to invest - "California" or "New York"

#Data -  R&D Spend | Administration | Marketing Spend | State      | Profit
#         165324.2    132456.7         459875.8         California   191226.9
