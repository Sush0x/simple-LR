#Multiple Linear Regression
#Theory  - y(Profit) = b0 + b1*x1(R&D Spend) + b2*x2(Administration)+....+ bn*xn

#Data is about 50 startup companies investing in the different sectors to gain profit
#Idea is to determine which investment leads to high profit or may be which city is good to invest - "California" or "New York"

#Data -  R&D Spend | Administration | Marketing Spend | State      | Profit
#         165324.2    132456.7         459875.8         California   191226.9

# Dummy Variable Trap - D2 = D1 - 1  therefore we don't keep b0 , D1 and D2 at same time in equation hence remove one Dummy variable in the eqn.

# p - value => used in null hypothesis 

u = assumed mean = 20 ounces
u' = calc. mean  = 22 ounces
sigma = variance , n = total number of observation

H0(Null hypothesis) => u = 20
H1(Alternate hypothesis) => u > 20

#p-value is calculated -
  z = (u' - u) / (sigma/sqrt(n))
  
 we calculate P(Z) - probibility at Z = <3>
 P = .0013 
 here P <0.05 therefore weak evidence hence we neglect the null hypothesis, hence u = 20 is not significant.
